## Welcome to DocPad's Documentation Repository

It's pulled into the Bevry and [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad-website) websites and rendered by DocPad into beautiful documentation. Feel free to submit pull requests and post issues for it; one of our moderators will get to your changes as quickly as possible :)


## Note on Links

Links inside the documentation will look like `/docpad/config`, and don’t work within GitHub. That’s because these are short links DocPad expands during generation process. You can try it out by cloning out the [DocPad Website](https://github.com/bevry/docpad-website) yourself :)
