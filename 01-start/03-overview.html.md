## Standard Project Structure

Here is the standard project structure you'll come accross with DocPad projects:

- `my-website/`
	- `out/`
	- `src/`
		- `documents/`
		- `files/`
		- `layouts/`
	- `package.json`


### The Documents Directory

Documents are files that we would like to render. Rendering occurs extension to extension in the same way the ruby on rails asset pipeline works. This means the document `src/documents/hello.ext1.ext2.ext3` is rendered from `ext3` to `ext2` then from `ext2` to `ext1`, resulting in the file `out/hello.ext1`. More common examples of this are rendering [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) to JavaScript with the document `src/documents/script.js.coffee` to `out/script.js` or writing a blog post that renders from [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to HTML with the document `src/documents/blog/hello.html.md` to `out/blog/hello.html`.

The reason we do not support direct rendering from `script.coffee` to `script.js` is that such a convention would eliminate the ability to combine extension renderings, as well as cause ambiguity between extensions that can be rendered in multiple ways. For instance the `coffee` extension could be rendered using [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) to JavaScript or using [CoffeeKup](http://coffeekup.org/) to HTML. However, if you really want to use just a single extension, such a thing is supported by the `renderSingleExtensions` meta property.

The other important aspect of documents it that they support meta data. Meta data goes at the top of a document and defines information about that particular document. For instance, its title, date, and layout it uses are good examples. Meta data is not restricted to particular values, meaning you can define whatever meta data you want against a document. There are some special meta data properties however which perform certain functions (e.g. `layout` is used for telling us which layout to wrap the document with). You can find the complete listing of special meta data properties on the [Meta Data Page](/docpad/meta-data).


### The Layouts Directory

Layouts work in a very similar way to documents in that they are rendered and support meta data, however unlike documents, they don't get output'ed to the out directory - as they only exist to wrap documents and other layouts within themselves. Layouts work in a nested fashion, with the desired layout being defined by the `layout` meta data property within the child layout/document.

Layouts should include the child content; this is done using the `content` [template data](/docpad/template-data) variable. Doing such a thing using the [Eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco/) templating engine via the [Eco Plugin](/plugin/eco)  would look like so `<%- @content %>`.


### The Files Directory

Files are like documents in that they are outputted to the out directory, however unlike documents, they are not rendered and do not having meta data. This is where you should put everything that doens't need to be rendered or need meta data. For example, images, vendor files, plain stylesheet and javascript files, etc.


### The `package.json` File

This file is needed for every node application. It defines the dependencies that your application requires - such as the DocPad version your site is created against, as well as what plugins you are running and whatever else. You can learn more about `package.json` files on [this page](/node/ecosystem) of our [Hands on Node Training](/node/preface).
