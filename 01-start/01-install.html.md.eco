_If you are upgrading from one major version to another, be sure to checkout our [Upgrade Guide](/docpad/upgrade) for information relating to backwards compatibility breaks._

1. [Install Node.js & other dependencies](/node/install)

1. Update NPM and install DocPad

	``` bash
	npm install -g npm; npm install -g docpad<%= if (v = @feedr?.feeds?.latestPackage?.version) then '@'+@getVersion(v,2) else '' %>
	```

1. **When upgrading:** run `docpad update` inside your project directory to ensure that your local installation of DocPad and its plugins are up-to-date with the latest compatible version.

1. If you want operating system notifications, follow [these additional instructions](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-growl#install). (Ignore the `install npm` instructions you completed earlier.)

_If you get any errors, try running DocPad anyway. Most installation errors are non-fatal, and just for debugging purposes. If you do get a fatal error, check out the [Troubleshooting Guide](/docpad/troubleshoot)...itâ€™s probably easily fixed. :)._
