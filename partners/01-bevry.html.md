Alternatively, if you already know what you're after:

- You can request a [Google Hangout on Air](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html) to be organised by a quick [Skype call](skype:balupton?add) or by a comment on the particular GitHub issue.
- You can also place [BountySource bounties](https://www.bountysource.com/faq#bounties) directly onto a GitHub Issue to priotize development of that issue.
- You can also use [GitTip donations](https://www.gittip.com/docpad/) to help accomplish the [DocPad roadmap](/docpad/roadmap) in general.
